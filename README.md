Research: VPN Encryption and Privacy Features

    Encryption Protocols:

        ProtonVPN uses OpenVPN and WireGuard with AES-256 encryption
        Ensures confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data

    Privacy Features:

        No-logs policy: Activity is not tracked or stored
        DNS leak protection: Prevents DNS requests from exposing IP
        Kill switch: Stops all traffic if VPN connection drops
        Tor over VPN (optional): Adds extra anonymity

    Benefits:

    Hides real IP address and location
    Encrypts internet traffic to protect against spying and snooping
    Access to geo-restricted content
    Provides anonymity on public Wi-Fi networks
    Bypasses censorship in restricted regions

    Limitations:

    Reduced speed compared to normal browsing
    Free VPNs may have limited server access and slower speeds
    Some websites may block VPN traffic (e.g., banking or streaming)
    Requires trust in VPN provider regarding logging policies
